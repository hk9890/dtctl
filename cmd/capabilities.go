// Unix plugin dispatch does via exec), and reaching for the host's disk outside
// the vfs seam. Every such path is gated on one of these, so an embedding
// caller — the service engine, `dtctl serve`, tests — can make it structurally
// unreachable instead of relying on configuration. The CLI binary grants
// everything; embedded callers grant nothing (see
// docs/dev/SERVICE_ENGINE_DESIGN.md).

	// an embedded invocation returns its rows inline instead.
