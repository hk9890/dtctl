// Package serve is the command surface for running dtctl as a server on top
// of pkg/engine. Each protocol is its own subcommand — `dtctl serve http`
// today, room for `dtctl serve mcp` and others without redefining what bare
// `serve` means. This file holds the parent command and the standalone
// dispatch; each protocol lives in its own file (http.go).
//
// The servers here are reference implementations. They carry no
// authentication of their own: every request brings the tenant token it runs
// with, and listeners bind to localhost by default. A real deployment puts
// its own authentication, TLS, and rate limiting in front (or embeds
// pkg/engine directly instead of shipping one of these servers).

// development-tier feature: released builds do not register the command unless
// the operator opts in with `dtctl config set development.serve on` or
// DTCTL_DEVELOPMENT=serve.

subprocesses are spawned. Requests execute one at a time per process.
