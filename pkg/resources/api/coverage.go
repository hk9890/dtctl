// It powers two things: the DTCTL column of `dtctl get apis` (and its inverse,
// `--uncovered`, which is a contribution backlog derived from the environment
// rather than hand-maintained), and the runtime notice `exec api` prints when a
// caller reaches for the passthrough on a path that already has a native
// command. That notice is what keeps the escape hatch self-deprecating.
//
// Every Command here is asserted against the real command tree by a test in
// cmd/, so an entry naming a command that no longer exists fails the build
// rather than misdirecting a caller.
