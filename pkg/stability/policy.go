// Policy is a deployment's stability constraint: an ordered floor plus a narrow
// list of per-command and per-flag exceptions to it.
//
// The exceptions exist because a single floor is too coarse for the motivating
// case. A team that wants one experimental command should not have to drop the
// floor, which would grant the *entire* experimental surface — including
// experimental flags added to already-allowed stable commands in a later
// release. And a tight command profile cannot substitute: profile matching is
// prefix-based and subtree-inclusive, so it is default-deny at a point in time
// but default-allow over time within an allowed subtree. Right for topics,
// wrong for a contract.

	// floor is experimental, so a feature the operator deliberately switched on
	// would be registered and then immediately blocked. The opt-in is
	// per-feature, out-of-band and strictly more explicit than a floor, so the
	// floor governs the tiers that ship *registered* — stable and experimental
	// — and leaves development to its own switch. Subtree-inclusive, because
