// downstream consumers read.
const ManifestHeader = `# dtctl stability manifest

<!-- GENERATED FILE — do not edit. Regenerate with: make stability-manifest -->

Every command and flag dtctl exposes, with the contract it carries. This file is
generated from the live command tree and checked in, so a change to the
contract shows up as a reviewable diff and a failing build rather than as a
silent break.

| Tier | Promise |
|---|---|
| ` + "`stable`" + ` | Invocation and output contract are additive-only. Removal or an incompatible change requires a deprecation cycle. |
| ` + "`experimental`" + ` | May change or be removed in any release. Not covered by dtctl's stability guarantees. |
| ` + "`development`" + ` | Unfinished, no guarantees. Not registered unless opted in via ` + "`dtctl config set development.<feature> on`" + `. |

Deprecation is not a tier: a deprecated command is still stable in shape and is
merely scheduled for removal. It is recorded on the same line.

## Choosing what this environment accepts

The **stability floor** is the weakest contract a command or flag may offer and
still be usable. It defaults to ` + "`experimental`" + `, so interactive use keeps
getting new (badged) surface. Automation should pin ` + "`stable`" + `:

` + "```bash" + `
# Per context, persisted in the config file
dtctl config set-context prod-agent --min-stability stable

# Per process — this is what an embedding service sets, and it is deliberately
# not a command-line flag: the embedder controls argv, so a flag would hand the
# opt-in to exactly the party the floor exists to constrain.
DTCTL_MIN_STABILITY=stable dtctl get workflows
` + "```" + `

A single below-floor command or flag can be admitted without lowering the floor
for everything. Each entry is one audited risk acceptance:

` + "```bash" + `
dtctl config set-context prod-agent --min-stability stable \
  --stability-exception 'ingest' \
  --stability-exception 'query --spill'
` + "```" + `

Development-tier features are enabled individually and never by a floor:

` + "```bash" + `
dtctl config list-development                 # what this build carries
dtctl config set development.serve on         # persistent
DTCTL_DEVELOPMENT=serve dtctl serve http      # one process
` + "```" + `

> **Versioning caveat.** ` + "`release-please-config.json`" + ` sets
> ` + "`bump-minor-pre-major`" + `, so pre-1.0 a breaking change currently ships as a
> minor bump. The ` + "`stable`" + ` tier is only as strong as the carve-out that
> exempts it from that policy — see the design doc's "Versioning policy"
> section. Until that is written down, treat this file as the inventory, not
> yet as the guarantee.
